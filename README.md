Build a Polymer 2.0 App From Scratch Codelab
===
See https://comcastsamples.github.io/polymer-whose-flag/ for codelab instructions.

Because conference Wi-Fi is unpredictable, it is recommended to follow these steps in advance of the start of the workshop to prepare your local environment for the Codelab:

1.  Download and install Node from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/). Node includes the node package manager command, `npm`.

2.  Install `bower` and `polymer-cli` globally:

        npm install -g bower polymer-cli

3.  Clone this repo:

        https://github.com/ComcastSamples/polymer-whose-flag.git

4.  Change directory to your local repo and install dependencies with `bower`:

        cd polymer-whose-flag
        bower install
